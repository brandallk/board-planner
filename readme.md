##### About the project

This is a simplified clone of the project-management app 'Trello'.

* Register/sign-in to access your private account
* Create a 'Board' dedicated to each of your projects
* Within a Board, create Lists and post Tasks and Comments
* Use drag-and-drop to rearrange Tasks in any order or swap them from List to List
* Invite new team-members to collaborate on shared Boards
* Don't worry: Your own contributions cannot be deleted by a collaborator

##### How the app was made

The app was built with NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, and Vue/Vuex.

This app is a collaborative project built by [Randy King](https://github.com/brandallk), [Russ Carr](https://github.com/RussCarr), and [Mike Miller](https://github.com/MichaelWMiller). We (Randy, Russ, and Mike) are full-stack web developer students at the Boise CodeWorks bootcamp.
